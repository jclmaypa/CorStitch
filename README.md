# Overview
An Automated Rapid Reef Assessment System (ARRAS) includes two parts. The first part is composed of a banca-towable platform equipped with a down-looking camera. By using the first part to conduct an ARRAS survey, we can obtain a belt transect video. A sample of this video can be seen below.

The second part of ARRAS is a software for automatic video stitching to create georeferenced visual records from the data collected from the first part. Enter CorStitch, a free, open-source software aimed at converting down-looking belt transect videos from ARRAS surveys into georeferenced mosaics. CorStitch can create panorama-like images called mosaics by using Fourier-based image registration.

Once the mosaics are created, they can then be georeferenced. CorStitch uses GNSS data to georeference the mosaics, and its main outputs are KMZ files and rectified mosaics.
