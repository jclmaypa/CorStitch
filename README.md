# CorStitch

CorStitch is a free, open-source software aimed at converting down-looking belt transect videos from ARRAS surveys into georeferenced mosaics.

## ARRAS Survey

An Automated Rapid Reef Assessment System (ARRAS) survey includes two parts. The first part is composed of a banca-towable platform equipped with a down-looking camera. The camera will scan the seafloor, and the video below is an example of what you will get from an ARRAS survey.
