# Overview
An Automated Rapid Reef Assessment System (ARRAS) includes two parts. The first part is composed of a banca-towable platform equipped with a down-looking camera. By using the first part to conduct an ARRAS survey, we can obtain a belt transect video. A sample of this video can be seen below.

The second part of ARRAS is a software for automatic video stitching to create georeferenced visual records from the data collected from the first part. Enter CorStitch, a free, open-source software aimed at converting down-looking belt transect videos from ARRAS surveys into georeferenced mosaics.
